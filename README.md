# Smart-Clothes-stand


This project will be help people to prevent their clothes from effects of excess drying or damaged caused by rainfall 2 moisture sensors and 1 rain sensor is used here

1.	The arduino collects the data from the sensor and sends it to the nodemcuESP2866
2.	The nodemcu sends this data to the mobile via its wifi-module
3.	The reason for not directly using the node-mcu is the lack of analog pins in nodemcu. We had to use 3 sensors which would not be possible if using the node-mcu alone

The following video-link showcases all features of the project and its working
